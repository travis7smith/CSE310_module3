# Module 3 (GIS) Overview

This module I was able to learn about Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In this project I had the oppertunity to explore the AcrGIS program that makes this easy to learn and apply.

To show what I learned I made a map that presents all types of power around the world whether it be wind, solar, thermal, or many others. It is an HTML file so that I will run on web browsers. I did this so that any device could use this program. You simple run the file then you can play with the page. You can scroll around the world, zoom in, focus on plants that produce a certain amount of energy, and read a little about that cluster. Such as how much energy is produced and what type of energy it is.

# Development Environment

Software:
* ArcGIS
* Your choice of browser
* I used Visual Studio Code to write the HTML file

# Useful Websites

* [AcrGIS Tutorial](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/tutorials/)
* [Maps Tutorial](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/maps/tutorials/apis/display-a-map/)
* [Display a scene tutorial](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/tutorials/)
* [Web Tutorial](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/apis-and-sdks/#web-apis)

# Future Work

* Add more information for each plant (ex: location, plant name, etc)
* Make it so you can filter the results by type of power (ex: show only nuclear power plants)
* I would like to actually program this to work on my iPhone and possibly an android
